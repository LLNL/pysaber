# PySABER

## Documentation
Documentation for PySABER is available at the link [https://pysaber.readthedocs.io/](https://pysaber.readthedocs.io/). 

## Introduction
PySABER is a python package for characterizing the X-ray source and detector blurs in cone-beam X-ray imaging systems. SABER is an abbreviation for systems approach to blur estimation and reduction. Once the parameters of both source and detector blurs are estimated, this package is also useful to reduce blur in radiographs using deblurring algorithms.
